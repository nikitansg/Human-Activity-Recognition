The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19â€“48 years. Each participant completed six activities while wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING). Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50 Hz.
